# test_email_formatting.py
# This test helps confirm that your email templates follow vendor-friendly best practices.
# It focuses on subject clarity, body structure, and attachment logic.

# ✅ Test Scenario:

# 1. Open:
#    templates/email_format_examples.txt

# 2. Review the subject line section. You should see:
#    ✅ [High] FortiGate Down - NY Office
#    ❌ Need Help ASAP

# 3. Now open:
#    templates/generic_ticket_template.txt

#    Replace placeholders with a realistic ticket:
#    - Issue: SentinelOne offline
#    - Severity: High
#    - Contact: jane.doe@example.com
#    - Troubleshooting Steps: Restarted agent, reviewed logs

# 4. Open an email client (or use a test inbox like Mailtrap.io)
# 5. Paste your subject line and body into a new draft message

# ✅ Expected Outcome:

# - Subject clearly communicates severity, product, and location
# - Body includes:
#     • Issue summary
#     • Contact information
#     • Troubleshooting steps taken
#     • Attachment note or upload fallback message

# ✅ Passes If:
# - The subject is structured (not vague or spammy)
# - The body is scannable and complete
# - Attachments are referenced or upload links are offered if skipped

# ❌ Fails If:
# - Subject is too vague ("Need help!!!", "Plz fix asap")
# - Body omits contact or action details
# - File attachments are referenced but missing — or skipped with no upload plan
