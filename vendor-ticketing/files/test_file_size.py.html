# test_file_size.py
# This test validates that file_size_checker.py correctly prevents oversized attachments from being used in ticket submissions.

# 🧪 What This Tests:
# Ensures that files over the defined limit (default: 25MB) are flagged with a warning and blocked from upload.

# ✅ Setup Instructions:

# Step 1: Open a terminal or PowerShell window.
# Step 2: Generate two test files:

#     fsutil file createnew large.zip 30000000     # 30MB file
#     fsutil file createnew small.zip 2000000      # 2MB file

# Step 3: Open:
#     utils/file_size_checker.py

# Step 4: At the bottom, uncomment the test calls:

#     is_file_size_acceptable('large.zip', 25)   # Should trigger warning
#     is_file_size_acceptable('small.zip', 25)   # Should pass

# ✅ Expected Output:
# - `large.zip` → ⚠️ WARNING: too large for upload
# - `small.zip` → ✅ OK to upload

# ✅ Passes If:
# - Files over the threshold print a clear warning
# - Files under the limit print a success message
# - No file is uploaded when over the limit

# ❌ Fails If:
# - Large files are treated as acceptable
# - No message is printed for either test case
