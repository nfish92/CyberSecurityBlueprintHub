# test_retry_logic.py
# This test verifies that your retry_throttle.py module adds delay when rate limits occur

# Step 1: Open 'utils/retry_throttle.py'
# Step 2: Uncomment ONE of the following:
#     # basic_delay(5)
#     # exponential_backoff(2)
#     # jittered_delay(3, 7)

# Step 3: Temporarily insert a timer to see how long it waits:
#     import time
#     start = time.time()
#     jittered_delay(3, 6)
#     print(f\"Waited: {round(time.time() - start, 2)}s\")

# Step 4 (Optional): Simulate a fake API response object:
#     class FakeResponse:
#         status_code = 429
#     handle_rate_limited_response(FakeResponse())

# Expected Output:
#     Script should wait between 3–6 seconds before printing.
#     Or:
#     Detected 429 — applying backoff.

# Test Passes If:
#     Delay happens, and output confirms rate limiting logic was triggered

# Test Fails If:
#     No delay, no message, or loop retries immediately
