# 🧪 Test Suite Index – Vendor Ticket Autobot

This folder contains standalone test files that let you validate each module of the blueprint — safely, and without executing live automation.

Each `.py` test is:
- Fully commented
- Mapped to a real blind spot
- Designed for controlled learning and simulation
