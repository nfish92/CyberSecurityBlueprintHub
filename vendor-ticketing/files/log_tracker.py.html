# log_tracker.py
# Logs vendor ticket submissions to a CSV file for tracking and auditing purposes.
# Helps you maintain a record of when, where, and why each ticket was submitted.
# All code is commented out for learning and safety in shared repositories.

# Pro Tip:
# Use this log as a searchable audit trail for follow-ups and vendor accountability.
# Consider logging the ticket ID (if available) and status (open, closed) in future versions.
