# file_uploader.py
# Demonstrates how to upload support bundles or debug files as part of a vendor ticket submission.
# Supports common formats like .zip, .pcap, .log, and .txt.
# All code is commented out for safe review and education.

# import requests

# def upload_file_to_vendor(config, file_path):
#     """
#     Uploads a file (e.g., support bundle) to a vendor API.
#     Uses multipart/form-data for compatibility with most REST endpoints.
#     :param config: Dictionary containing 'file_upload_endpoint' and optionally 'api_key'
#     :param file_path: Path to the local file to upload
#     """
#
#     # Target upload endpoint (e.g., /upload or /attachments)
#     # endpoint = config['file_upload_endpoint']
#
#     # Prepare file payload using multipart encoding
#     # files = {'file': open(file_path, 'rb')}
#
#     # Optional: Add authorization if required
#     # headers = {
#     #     'Authorization': f"Bearer {config['api_key']}"
#     # }
#
#     # Send the POST request to upload the file
#     # response = requests.post(endpoint, files=files, headers=headers)
#
#     # Print the response for debugging
#     # print(f"Upload response: {response.status_code} – {response.text}")
#
#     # Simulated upload output
#     # print(f"Simulated file upload: {file_path}")

# Pro Tip:
# Always validate file size before uploading (see file_size_checker.py).
# Some APIs return a success code (200) even if the file fails silently — always check the response text too.
