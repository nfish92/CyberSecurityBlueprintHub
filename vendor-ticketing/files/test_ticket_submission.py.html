# test_ticket_submission.py
# This test simulates a ticket submission and confirms that the correct delivery method (email or API) is selected.
# No actual email or API request will be sent — just logic verification.

# 🧪 What This Tests:
# Ensures that `main.py` correctly routes the submission logic based on config["method"].

# ✅ Test Instructions:

# Step 1: Open:
#     main.py

# Step 2: Uncomment or define the test ticket:
#     ticket = {
#         "issue": "Endpoint offline",
#         "severity": "High",
#         "contact": "noc@example.com"
#     }

# Step 3: Set vendor explicitly:
#     vendor = "example_vendor"

# Step 4: Locate the method branching logic and temporarily replace the action with a print:

#     if config["method"] == "email":
#         print(f"Simulated send to email for vendor {vendor}")
#     elif config["method"] == "api":
#         print(f"Simulated send to api for vendor {vendor}")
#     else:
#         print("❌ Unknown submission method")

# ✅ Expected Output:
# - If the method is set to `"email"` → prints: `Simulated send to email for vendor example_vendor`
# - If set to `"api"` → prints: `Simulated send to api for vendor example_vendor`

# ✅ Passes If:
# - Output matches the configured delivery method
# - Logic flows without errors or crashing

# ❌ Fails If:
# - Wrong path is taken
# - No output or logic block is skipped
# - An unrecognized method isn't caught by the fallback print
