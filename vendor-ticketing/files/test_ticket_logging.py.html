# test_ticket_logging.py
# This test verifies that ticket submissions are logged correctly to `ticket_history.csv`.

# 🧪 What This Tests:
# Confirms that ticket details (vendor, issue, contact, etc.) are appended as a new CSV row — cleanly and completely.

# ✅ Test Instructions:

# Step 1: Open:
#     utils/log_tracker.py

# Step 2: Uncomment the function:
#     log_ticket()

# Step 3: Paste this test call somewhere in your main script:

#     log_ticket('fortinet', {
#         'ticket_id': 'FTN-1001',
#         'issue': 'Firewall unreachable',
#         'severity': 'High',
#         'contact': 'noc-team@example.com',
#         'method': 'email',
#         'file_size_mb': 3.1,
#         'upload_method': 'attachment',
#         'result': 'Success'
#     })

# Step 4: After running, open:
#     logs/ticket_history.csv

# ✅ Expected Output:
# - A new row appears with the current timestamp followed by the full ticket data
# - Fields are properly comma-separated and aligned

# ✅ Passes If:
# - All fields appear with no missing or malformed values
# - Timestamp is correct
# - File opens cleanly in Excel, Notepad, etc.

# ❌ Fails If:
# - No row is written
# - CSV format is broken
# - Fields are missing or out of order
