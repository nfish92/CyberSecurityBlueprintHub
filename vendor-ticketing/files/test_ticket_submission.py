# test_ticket_submission.py
# This test shows how to simulate a ticket submission using email or API method
# You won't actually send a ticket — this test just ensures logic branches work correctly

# Step 1: Open 'main.py'
# Step 2: Uncomment the 'ticket' dictionary to define an example issue
# Step 3: Set 'vendor = "example_vendor"' directly in the script
# Step 4: Uncomment the entire section that checks:
#     if config['method'] == 'email':
#         send_email_ticket(...)
#     elif config['method'] == 'api':
#         send_api_ticket(...)
#     else:
#         print(...)

# Step 5: Temporarily replace 'send_email_ticket' and 'send_api_ticket' with a print statement:
#     print(f\"Simulated send to {config['method']} for vendor {vendor}\")

# Expected Output:
#     Should print either:
#     Simulated send to email for vendor example_vendor
#     OR
#     Simulated send to api for vendor example_vendor

# Test Passes If:
#     The correct method is chosen based on the config

# Test Fails If:
#     It uses the wrong method, crashes, or doesn't hit the print at all
