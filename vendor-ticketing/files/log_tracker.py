# log_tracker.py
# This file shows how a simple logging function might work for storing ticket history.
# It's meant to help learners understand how to log data safely and consistently.

# import csv
# from datetime import datetime

# def log_ticket(vendor, ticket):
#     # Define log file path
#     # log_file = 'logs/ticket_history.csv'

#     # Create a timestamp
#     # timestamp = datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')

#     # Data to write
#     # row = [timestamp, vendor, ticket['issue'], ticket['severity'], ticket['contact']]

#     # Write to CSV (append mode)
#     # with open(log_file, 'a', newline='') as f:
#     #     writer = csv.writer(f)
#     #     writer.writerow(row)

#     # Simulated output
#     # print("Ticket logged (simulated).")
