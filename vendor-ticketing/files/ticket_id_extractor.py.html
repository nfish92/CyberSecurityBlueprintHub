# ticket_id_extractor.py
# Demonstrates how to extract ticket or case IDs from API responses or email subject lines.
# These IDs are critical for follow-ups, automation logs, and status polling.
# All code is commented out for safe learning and blueprint use.

# === Example 1: Extract Ticket ID from API JSON Response ===
# def extract_id_from_api_response(response_json):
#     """
#     Extracts the ticket ID from a vendor API response.
#     Expected format: { "status": "success", "ticket_id": "ABC-12345", "message": "Created" }
#     """
#     # return response_json.get("ticket_id", "UNKNOWN")

# === Example 2: Extract Ticket ID from Email Subject Line ===
# import re

# def extract_id_from_subject(subject_line):
#     """
#     Extracts ticket ID from email subject line using regex.
#     Matches formats like: [ABC-12345], [CASE-2024-7781], [TKT-009]
#     """
#     # match = re.search(r"\[(.*?)\]", subject_line)
#     # if match:
#     #     return match.group(1)
#     # return "UNKNOWN"

# === Simulated Usage ===
# response = { "ticket_id": "XYZ-9999" }
# print(extract_id_from_api_response(response))  # Output: XYZ-9999

# subject = "RE: [CASE-2024-4488] Endpoint offline"
# print(extract_id_from_subject(subject))        # Output: CASE-2024-4488

# Pro Tip:
# Always extract and log the ticket ID for long-term tracking. It's the only way to reference cases later via portal, email, or API.
