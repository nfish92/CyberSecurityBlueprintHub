# 🧠 Auto Vendor Ticket Bot (Static Blueprint)

This is a **static, learning-first blueprint**, not a live automation tool.  
It’s designed to help NOC/SOC engineers, MSPs, and cybersecurity teams build **safe, scalable, and reliable** vendor ticketing automations — while avoiding the subtle issues that usually cause them to fail.

All Python code is **fully commented out**, making it safe to copy, test, or extend without accidentally firing off real emails or API requests.

## 🔍 What Are "Blind Spots"?

Blind spots are the real-world failures developers often overlook under pressure — the stuff that doesn't show up in tutorials, but causes silent failures in production.

Common examples include:
- Uploading a 40MB file that silently gets blocked
- Forgetting to extract the ticket ID and being unable to follow up
- Getting rate-limited after retrying too fast
- Submitting vague emails that get ignored by support teams

This project isn’t just about writing automation code — it’s about helping you avoid the things that make automation unreliable, brittle, or untraceable.

## 🎯 Why This Exists

Most teams **already have the data** needed to open tickets — they just lack a safe, reusable, and field-tested framework.  
This blueprint gives you a vendor-agnostic foundation with modules you can adapt to:

- 🌐 ISPs (e.g. Verizon, Comcast, Spectrum)  
- 🔥 Firewalls (e.g. Fortinet, Palo Alto, Cisco ASA)  
- 🛡️ EDR/XDR platforms (e.g. SentinelOne, CrowdStrike)  
- ☁️ Cloud vendors (e.g. Microsoft 365, Azure, AWS)  
- 🧰 Security products (e.g. Umbrella, Meraki, Tenable)

## 🧠 Blindspot Coverage Map

Unlike most code samples that stop at "email sent" or "API call made," this blueprint covers what happens next — and what could break.

Each blind spot below is paired with a ready-to-use mitigation module:

1. **Support Bundle Uploads** → `support_bundle_upload.py`  
2. **Ticket ID Retrieval** → `ticket_id_extractor.py`  
3. **Rate Limiting & Retry Logic** → `retry_throttle.py`  
4. **Vendor-Specific Field Validation** → `config_validator.py`  
5. **Auth Failures / Token Expiry** → `auth_handler.py`  
6. **Secret Management** → `.env.example` + `secret_loader.py`  
7. **Email Formatting Pitfalls** → `email_format_examples.txt`  
8. **Oversized Attachment Rejection** → `file_size_checker.py`

## 📁 Key Modules & What They Do

| File                              | Role in the Blueprint |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------|
| `main.py`                         | Master control flow (simulation only) |
| `example_vendor.json`            | Blindspot-aware vendor profile |
| `generic_ticket_template.txt`    | Structured ticket body with key fields |
| `email_format_examples.txt`      | Shows good vs bad subject/body formatting |
| `ticket_history.csv`             | Stores ticket metadata and audit logs |
| `email_sender.py`                | Simulated email submission via SMTP |
| `api_caller.py`                  | Simulated API-based ticket submission |
| `file_size_checker.py`           | Blocks or warns on files >25MB |
| `support_bundle_upload.py`       | Adds file uploads or fallback links |
| `config_validator.py`            | Confirms required fields per vendor |
| `ticket_id_extractor.py`         | Parses ticket IDs from API/email |
| `retry_throttle.py`              | Introduces delay/backoff strategies |
| `auth_handler.py`                | Detects and reacts to expired logins or tokens |
| `secret_loader.py`               | Loads secrets from a `.env` file |
| `.env.example`                   | Template for secure environment variables |

## 🧪 Built-In Test Suite

The `/tests/` folder includes static test files to verify each module's logic.  
No network calls. No real tickets. Just logic validation.

| Test File                      | What It Validates |
|-------------------------------|--------------------|
| `test_config_validation.py`   | Missing field detection |
| `test_file_size.py`           | File upload cap logic |
| `test_ticket_submission.py`   | Email vs API routing |
| `test_retry_logic.py`         | Delay and rate-limit handling |
| `test_ticket_logging.py`      | Audit CSV structure |
| `test_email_formatting.py`    | Formatting and subject clarity |

Each test includes step-by-step instructions and expected results.

## ✅ How to Use This Blueprint

1. Open any `.py` or `.txt` file.
2. Read the comments — all real logic is safely commented out.
3. Copy the logic into your own live tool, adapting config and credentials.
4. Use the `/tests/` files to verify behavior before launching.

---

## 💬 Final Thought

Most automation scripts fail **not because of the core logic**, but because of what they ignore:
- File size
- Field requirements
- Retry strategy
- Missing ticket ID
- Expired credentials

This blueprint gives you a proven starting point, full of lessons learned the hard way — so you don’t have to repeat them.
